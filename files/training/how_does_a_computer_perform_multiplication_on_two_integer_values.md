How does a computer perform multiplication on two integer values?

"Multiply like Yoda might say: Not hard, just sideways adding it is."

Picture yourself as an intergalactic computer, and today your mission is to multiply two integer values given to you. But in your universe, numbers aren't written as you might expect them to be on Earth. Instead, everything is in binary form—1s and 0s. Let's dive in and see how you, as this binary-speaking computer, tackle multiplication.

Let's say you're tasked with multiplying two earthly numbers, 3 and 2. Before you get started, these need to be translated into your language:

- The number **3** becomes **11** in binary.
- The number **2** is represented as **10**.

You're ready to begin. In your world of bits, multiplication is quite similar to adding numbers repeatedly, with a bit of help from alignment tricks.

Imagine laying it out like a multiplication problem you might see in school:

```
      11  (This is 3)
    x 10  (This is 2)
   ------
```

Start by focusing on the rightmost digit of the second number, following the simple idea of "multiply and shift." Here's what happens:

- **First Row**: When the digit is 0 (either from 10): Anything multiplied by 0 is 0, so you simply get:

  ```
  00
  ```

- **Second Row**: Here's where it gets interesting. Move to the next digit in 10, which is 1 (in its left position). Multiply 11 by this 1. Since anything multiplied by 1 remains unchanged, you just write back 11, but—pay close attention—you shift it one position to the left!

  ```
  11
  ```

Now, stack them up like you would in a classic addition problem and **add the results together**:

```
     00  (The product from the rightmost digit)
    110  (The shifted product from the leftmost digit)
  ------
    110  (Sum them up, binary style)
```

The sum, **110**, is what you end up with in your beautiful binary world.

### Let's Revisit How We Shift and Add

- **Multiplying by Zero**: Anytime a 0 is involved, the result is always zero. Simple and unchanging.
- **Multiplying by One**: This keeps the number as it is, but remember to shift its position left by the order of the bit.

When the final bits land in binary form as **110**, let’s return them to Earth:

- **110** in binary translates to the decimal number **6**.

### Key Takeaway

Multiplying in binary combines the steps of addition and strategic placement—it's about lining up products and gathering them just as you'd stack layers of bricks. Every time you deal with a 1, you perform a regular addition laterally (shifted left), while 0s mean you take a break on that line. As a binary guru, you can achieve multiplication quickly through these neat steps—just as you would with addition, but in a way that paints a more complex tapestry across the planes of binary space.

By understanding this melody of bits and their shifts, you, as a computer, can master multiplication—whether you’re calculating the price of a hyperdrive or coordinating intergalactic trade routes, multiplication with 1s and 0s lays the groundwork.
