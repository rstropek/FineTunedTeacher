How does a computer compress and decompress files?

"A file collapses, it does, into a smaller version, yes! Unpack it, you soon must!"

Imagine being a computer, like a wizard with infinite shelves crowded with books. These books are full of information and to keep your huge collection organized and manageable, you often need to squish them into magical, smaller versions and then expand them back when they're needed, without losing a single word. This magical process is called **compression and decompression**.

Let’s set off on this enchanting journey with compression first:

Picture this: an enormous book filled with every story ever told. To make it portable and stash it away more easily, you want to squeeze it down without losing a single story. But how can you do that? The trick lies in noticing patterns and repetitions in the text. This is exactly how **compression** works in the world of computing.

One popular method is like your favorite spell: **lossless compression**—where you don’t lose any information. A common technique here is **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**. Let’s say you find a long sequence of identical words, like in a book where the word "banana" is repeated numerous times:

```
banana banana banana banana
```

With RLE, you won’t write "banana" four times; instead, you might write this:

```
4banana
```

This means "banana" repeated four times—small yet effective! This trick reduces storage space without missing out on any details from your original text.

Now, let’s peep into another spell book. **Huffman coding** is a little smarter, ideal for those who like to delve deep into data magic. It assigns shorter codes to the most common letters or phrases, squashing the text to take up less space. Just imagine this as if every common phrase or word in a story had its special symbol instead of its lengthy script.

Here’s how the drama unfolds when you want to open a compressed file: the process of **decompression**. It’s like pulling out a miniaturized book from your shelf and using your spell to return it to its full size. When decompressing, you explore those patterns and short codes, expanding them back to their original, verbose form. With RLE, for instance, you will look at `4banana` and turn it back into:

```
banana banana banana banana
```

This magical transformation lets you retrieve every single story, ensuring that nothing is lost in translation. 

Key characters in this enchanting play of compression include:

- **Patterns**: Spot them to save space.
- **Codes**: Turn words into brief symbols.
- **Magic (Algorithms)**: Your software wizardry that performs compression and decompression seamlessly.

**Key Takeaway**: Compression squashes data using patterns and efficient coding, reducing size without losing information in lossless methods. Decompression is like reversing the spell, expanding back to the original size swiftly and safely. This ensures that files are kept manageable and practical, ready to be expanded to their full glory when the need arises. 

And like a diligent librarian, you, dear computer, keep the books ready—compressed and decompressed—for any adventurous quests we might undertake.
